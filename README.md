## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was fun, i learned a lot:

- Until now i have learned that starting with the mobile-first approach is easier than desktop-first.

- min-width in media queries is for when the screen is that size or larger
  max-width is when the screen size that size or shorter.

- The breakpoints are decided by the content, not the devices, it's better to make a breakpoint where the design breaks, rather than making it for a specific device width.

- I learnt how to use downloaded fonts with @font-face in css.

- I tried to follow the DRY principle the best that i could. Creating utility classes for styles that i used repeatedly.

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn but it was a fun and rewarding design to build. im hoping to level up my css and html skills by making tons of projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - This is my primary source when searching how to use css properties and html tags.

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/css-marker-pseudo-element) - This article helped me understand how to style the bullet points for the li elements.
